It contains the full text review and data-extraction database (the full database including title/abstract screening was too large to upload).

It also contains .dta files (Stata extension) containing all the data from systematic review studies (PCa/PSA categories/MD) and IPD studies (IPD PCa/PSA - complete [(categorical)]).

The .do file used to clean and analyse all the data is also provided ("complete code.do").

The data files do not contain any individual data, and the .do file doesn't contain any file paths, or data cleaning of the raw individual-participant data.
